## Project overview

Do road and traffic characteristics influence the number of serious collisions in a surrounding area? Does the density of liquor resellers?  This project  explores these issues by fitting a generalized linear model via multiple linear regression. The model utilizes a conditional autoregressive (CAR) specification to account for spatially correlated errors of a continuous response, which in this case is the mean response of a poisson distribution conceptualized as a 2d surface.
